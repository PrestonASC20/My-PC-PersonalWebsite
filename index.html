    <p id="About">
        I grew up in Fort Green New York and I have continued to become a stronger artist due to my passion for art, technology and music. At Community Roots Charter School, I developed a passion for sculpting when I started sculpting wax and since then I knew that I loved to share creative works with others not only to feel happy from people's enjoyment of my projects, but to also gain input and feedback on my projects so that I can make new projects that are better than the ones before it. Despite going to school in Pennsylvania away from my home, I know I have support and the conviction to keep working and creating which will help me out.    </p>
